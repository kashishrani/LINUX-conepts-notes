ðŸ“š Primary partitions are the main partitions on a hard drive and can be used to install an operating system.
ðŸ”„ Extended partitions are used to create additional logical partitions.
ðŸ’¾ Logical partitions are contained within extended partitions and are used for data storage.
ðŸ“Š Linux allows up to four primary partitions or three primary partitions and one extended partition.
ðŸš€ Using logical partitions can overcome the limitation of only having four primary partitions.
ðŸ“‘ GParted is a popular graphical tool for creating and managing partitions in Linux.ðŸ”’ It is important to be cautious when modifying partitions, as data loss can occur if not done correctly.


If adding the disk while the machine is running, there is chance the disk might not be visible with ldblk command. To rescan the newly added disk use folowing commands:
ls sys/clsss/sci_host/ | while read host; do echo "---" > /sys/class/sci_host/$host/scan; done
